## Proposal
_(approx. 2-3 pages)_

### Domain Background
_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, provide brief details on the background information of the domain from which the project is proposed. Historical information relevant to the project should be included. It should be clear how or why a problem in the domain can or should be solved. Related academic research should be appropriately cited in this section, including why that research is relevant. Additionally, a discussion of your personal motivation for investigating a particular problem in the domain is encouraged but not required.

**Olles**
Demand predictions in supply chain managagemnt (SCM) and logistics have historically been a constant pressure to make them more precise (Thomas & Griffin, 1996). The reason for this is due to the fact that inaccurate forecasting results in either too low supply to fulfill the current market demand, or too much, which in turn results in increased holding costs from inventory. 

Common ways to predict demand in SCM have been statistical models such as the ARIMA model (Jaipuria & Mahapatra, 2014). Academic articles have tested and noted that more advanced neural networks does not show a statistically significant improvement over traditional statistical models such as Moving Average and ARIMA (Shukla & Jharkharia, 2011). 

The key area of interest is: As an organisation grow larger, the more vital the precision in these predicitons become. Therefore, we will explore the possibility to utilise Machine Learning algorithms to predict the demand of certain products, in order for the SCM-team to make better planning for instance purchasing product components for an upcoming season. 

### Problem Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

In this section, clearly describe the problem that is to be solved. The problem described should be well defined and should have at least one relevant potential solution. Additionally, describe the problem thoroughly such that it is clear that the problem is quantifiable (the problem can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the problem can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the problem can be reproduced and occurs more than once).

**Olle** 
The problem organisations SCM-departments face is that inaccurate forecasting for future demand cost organisations a lot of either missed sales or increased costs due to handling and storage of inventory (Thomas & Griffin, 1996). Therefore, we will test the hypothesis of comapring classic and more common statistical demand forecasting models to the more recent neural networks and machine learning algorithms, to assess if they produce better results. This will be used for predicting the department-wide sales for each store for the following year given our dataset of 45 retail stores.

### Datasets and Inputs
_(approx. 2-3 paragraphs)_

In this section, the dataset(s) and/or input(s) being considered for the project should be thoroughly described, such as how they relate to the problem and why they should be used. Information such as how the dataset or input is (was) obtained, and the characteristics of the dataset or input, should be included with relevant references and citations as necessary It should be clear how the dataset(s) or input(s) will be used in the project and whether their use is appropriate given the context of the problem.

**Olle** 

We will use the dataset provided by Manjeet Singh on Kaggle.com "Retail Data Analytics
Historical sales data from 45 stores" [link](https://www.kaggle.com/manjeetsingh/retaildataset). We are provided with historical sales data for 45 stores located in different regions - each store contains a number of departments. The company also runs several promotional markdown events throughout the year. These markdowns precede prominent holidays, the four largest of which are the Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The weeks including these holidays are weighted five times higher in the evaluation than non-holiday weeks. 

In the dataset we find three separate files: Features, Sales and Stores

#### 1. Features data set.csv

Contains data related to the store, department, and regional activity for the given dates.

* Store - the store number
* Date - the week
* Temperature - average temperature in the region
* Fuel_Price - cost of fuel in the region
* MarkDown1-5 - anonymized data related to promotional markdowns. MarkDown data is only available after * Nov 2011, and is not available for all stores all the time. Any missing value is marked with an NA
* CPI - the consumer price index
* Unemployment - the unemployment rate
* IsHoliday - whether the week is a special holiday week
* Sales

#### 2. sales data-set.csv

Historical sales data, which covers to 2010-02-05 to 2012-11-01. Within this tab you will find the following fields:

* Store - the store number
* Dept - the department number
* Date - the week
* Weekly_Sales -  sales for the given department in the given store
* IsHoliday - whether the week is a special holiday week


#### 3. stores data-set.csv

Anonymized information about the 45 stores, indicating the type and size of store

* The store number (anonomised) 
* Type 
* Size


### Solution Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

In this section, clearly describe a solution to the problem. The solution should be applicable to the project domain and appropriate for the dataset(s) or input(s) given. Additionally, describe the solution thoroughly such that it is clear that the solution is quantifiable (the solution can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the solution can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the solution can be reproduced and occurs more than once).

**Olle** 

How we would solve this problem is to test the hypothesis of Neural Networks providing a better prediction compared to classical statistical models, such as the moving average. We will do this through analysing the historical patterns in combination with the added features mentioned to predict how tomorrows demand will look like. 


### Benchmark Model
_(approximately 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, provide the details for a benchmark model or result that relates to the domain, problem statement, and intended solution. Ideally, the benchmark model or result contextualizes existing methods or known information in the domain and problem given, which could then be objectively compared to the solution. Describe how the benchmark model or result is measurable (can be measured by some metric and clearly observed) with thorough detail.

**Olle** 

The initial benchmark model will be a moving average model as it is a simple and computationally inexpensive model or potentially the ARIMA model (Shukla & Jharkharia, 2011), and use that prediction score as a benchmark when we compare it to our machine learning algortihm. 


### Evaluation Metrics
_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, propose at least one evaluation metric that can be used to quantify the performance of both the benchmark model and the solution model. The evaluation metric(s) you propose should be appropriate given the context of the data, the problem statement, and the intended solution. Describe how the evaluation metric(s) are derived and provide an example of their mathematical representations (if applicable). Complex evaluation metrics should be clearly defined and quantifiable (can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms). 

**Olle** 

Ways to evalute the different models could include mean squared error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). All of which will help us to assess which models are providing us with the better demand forecast model. 

### Project Design
_(approx. 1 page)_

In this final section, summarize a theoretical workflow for approaching a solution given the problem. Provide thorough discussion for what strategies you may consider employing, what analysis of the data might be required before being used, or which algorithms will be considered for your implementation. The workflow and discussion that you provide should align with the qualities of the previous sections. Additionally, you are encouraged to include small visualizations, pseudocode, or diagrams to aid in describing the project design, but it is not required. The discussion should clearly outline your intended workflow of the capstone project.

To start we will visualise the data to get a better grip of what it looks like and how the different categorical data could be helping in the predictive demand forecasting model.
